# Free-Slot-Finder
This is a simple project, in which members of a group enter their free slots and it displays when all the members are free together.
I hope to add second best and third best option also in it.
I have done the backend on Node Js and the data is stored on MongoDB.
Front end is done on basic html-css.
Hbs templating engine is used.
